Implement a comprehensive Instagram automation suite for the CreatorHub platform using Node.js and the `instagram-graph-api`. The implementation should integrate seamlessly with the existing MongoDB backend and React frontend.

### Key Requirements:
1. **DM Automation Service**: 
   - Create a backend service to monitor incoming direct messages.
   - Implement functionality to send automated responses based on customizable triggers.
2. **Post Automation Engine**: 
   - Develop API endpoints to programmatically upload and schedule Reels, Stories, and Feed posts.
   - Ensure support for media processing and caption metadata.
3. **Data Aggregator**: 
   - Build a synchronization worker to fetch account metadata, follower counts, and media engagement metrics.
   - Store and update this data in the MongoDB `Creator` and `Analytics` schemas.
4. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Connect these features to the React dashboard using the existing premium glassmorphism design system.
   - Ensure the UI provides both manual overrides and AI-driven automation controls.

### Technical Specifications:
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express, Mongoose.
- **Library**: `instagram-private-api` (handle sessions and 2FA using the existing login modal system).
- **Styling**: Adhere to `Base.css` variables and maintain high-end micro-animations.
- **Architecture**: Maintain a clear separation between Instagram service logic and API controllers.
